DevOps Automation
Automation is the crucial need for DevOps practices, and automate everything is the fundamental principle of DevOps. Automation kick starts from the code generation on the developers machine, until the code is pushed to the code and after that to monitor the application and system in the production.

Automating infrastructure set up and configurations, and software deployment is the key highlight of DevOps practice. DevOps practice id is dependent on automation to make deliveries over a few hours and make frequent deliveries across platforms.

Automation in DevOps boosts speed, consistency, higher accuracy, reliability, and increases the number of deliveries. Automation in DevOps encapsulates everything right from the building, deploying, and monitoring.

DevOps Automation Tools
In large DevOps team that maintain extensive massive IT infrastructure can be classified into six categories, such as:


 

Infrastructure Automation
Configuration Management
Deployment Automation
Performance Management
Log management
Monitoring
Below are few tools in each of these categories let see in brief, such as:

Infrastructure Automation
Amazon Web Services (AWS): Being a cloud service, you don't need to be physically present in the data center, they are easy to scale on-demand, and there are no up-front hardware costs. It can be configured to provide more servers based on traffic automatically.

Configuration Management
Chef: Chef is a handy DevOps tool for achieving speed, scale, and consistency. It can be used to ease out of complex tasks and perform configuration management. With the help of this tool, the DevOps team can avoid making changes across ten thousand servers. Rather, they need to make changes in one place, which is automatically reflected in other servers.

Deployment Automation
Jenkins: It facilitates continuous integration and testing. It helps to integrate project changes more efficiently by quickly finding issues as soon as built is deployed.

Performance Management
App Dynamic: It offers real-time performance monitoring. The data collected by this tool help developers to debug when issues occur.

Log Management
Splunk: This DevOps tool solves issues such as storing, aggregating, and analyzing all logs in one place.

Monitoring
Nagios: It notified people when infrastructure and related service go down. Nagios is a tool for this purpose, which helps the DevOps team to find and correct problems.
